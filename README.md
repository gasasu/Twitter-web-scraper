# Twitter-web-scraper

Hello and welcome!!

This is a web scraper built by Gabriel Sasu.

This is meant for educational and adventurous purposes only and I would appreciate it to be used as such.
This web scraper collects and analyzes thousands of tweets all at once and filters based on your preferences.
Very valuable if you want to keep up with information on Twitter but don't want to scroll through thousands of tweets
Feel free to download or fork any parts of the project. I built it to be open source.

To use the web scraper make sure you download all the required libraries and set up a virtual environment preferrably.


Have Fun!!!
